## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Libraries: `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `pytorch`, `scikit-learn`

### Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Aram-Milan/DeepLearning_MNIST_and_CIFAR10.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the directory**:
   ```sh
   cd DeepLearning_MNIST_and_CIFAR10
   ```
3. **Install the dependencies**:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Code
- For Neural Network, run:
  ```sh
  jupyter nbconvert --execute --to notebook "src/Task_1_CIFAR10.ipynb" 
  jupyter nbconvert --execute --to notebook "src/Task_1_Mnist_&_FashionMnist_Datasets.ipynb"
  ```
- For CNN, run:
  ```sh
  jupyter nbconvert --execute --to notebook "src/Task_2_CIFAR10_CNN.ipynb"
  ```
  
### Producing results
Alternatively, you can open the notebook files directly in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab to execute the cells and visualize the results interactively. The random seed used is 42.
